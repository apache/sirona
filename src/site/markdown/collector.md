# Collector

Collector modules aims to aggregate data from multiple instances.

## Features

Default implementation only store data in memory.

## Configuration

Just use the collector `DataStoreFactory`: `org.apache.sirona.collector.server.store.CollectorDataStoreFactory`.

For instance your `commons-monitoring.properties` can look like:

```
org.apache.sirona.store.DataStore = org.apache.sirona.collector.server.store.CollectorDataStoreFactory
```

The `GaugeDataStore` can be configured through `org.apache.sirona.collector.gauge.store-class` property.
By default it uses the in memory implementation but you can set your own one if you want.

Note: if your `GaugeDataStore` has a constructor with a `String`, the marker of the store will be passed to the `GaugeDataStore`.

The `CounterDataStore` needs to be an instance of `org.apache.sirona.counters.CollectorCounterStore`.
By default it is in memory too but it is easily extensible to be persisted if needed.

## Installing the collector

To setup the collector you just need to configure the `DataStoreFactory` (see configuration part) and configure the
servlet `org.apache.sirona.collector.server.Collector`.

## Pushing data

The input is an array of event. Events are either gauges or counters.

Here is an array with a single gauge:

```json
[{"type": "gauge","time": "-","data": {"unit":"u","marker":"client1","value":0.0,"role":"mock"}}]
```

And here is an array with a single counter:

```json
[{"type": "counter","time": "2013-10-21T12:50:40Z","data": {"min":1.4,"unit":"ns","hits":4,"max":2.9,"marker":"client1","name":"test","concurrency":0,"m2":1.4099999999999997,"sum":8.2,"mean":2.05,"role":"performances","variance":0.4699999999999999}}]
```
